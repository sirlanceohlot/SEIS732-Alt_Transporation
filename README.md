# SEIS732-Alt_Transporation

The Metropolitan Council is looking to create marketing materials to promote alternative transportation into downtown Minneapolis around US Bank Stadium during concerts to alleviate the inevitable congestion large scale events brings. The Minnesota Department of Transportation has a plethora of informational reports about traffic in the metro for the marketing to comb over, but at the end of the day they are not data scientists. So, they’d like to have a local firm create a custom reporting solution to back their marketing efforts. The Metropolitan Council has approached Carlson & Mack Analytics to research average concert attendance and traffic volumes in the main highways/interstates surrounding US Bank.​
